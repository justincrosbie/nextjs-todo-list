            There is a lot of information out there. Most of it is misleading - it is designed to tear us apart, and polarise us, and confuse us.

            I have a lot of life experience. And I have read a lot. And most importantly, I have come to some realisations. Mostly due to transformations that I experienced over certain periods in my live, that have caused me to grow.
